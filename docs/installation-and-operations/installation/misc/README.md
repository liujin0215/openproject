# Instruction for specific platforms

OpenProject only comes either as [docker container](../docker/) or a [package](../packaged/).
The respective sections explain everything you need to know.

To make things easier here we give further instructions on how to get up and running with OpenProject
on different platforms which use either the docker container or the package:

* [Kubernetes](../kubernetes)
* [Synology](../synology)
* [Manual (not recommended)](../manual)
